# Reduce Your Bits

Reduce Your Bits is a web application built using React.js that demonstrates the use of Huffman encoding algorithm to improve efficiency in data storage. The webapp showcases the application of data structures and the greedy method to find the optimal encoding for characters, reducing the number of bits required to represent them.




## Introduction
Huffman encoding is a lossless compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence in a given dataset. By representing frequently occurring characters with shorter codes and less frequently occurring characters with longer codes, Huffman encoding achieves a more efficient representation of the data.

"Reduce Your Bits" demonstrates the step-by-step process of building a Huffman tree and generating the optimal bit-wise codes for each character in the input dataset. It provides a clear visualization of the Huffman tree and allows users to explore how different characters are encoded.
